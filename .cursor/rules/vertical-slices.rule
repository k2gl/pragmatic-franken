# Vertical Slices Architecture Enforcement

## Core Principle
All feature code MUST be organized in `src/{Module}/Features/{FeatureName}/` structure.

## Rules

### ✅ DO
- Create new features under `src/*/Features/{FeatureName}/`
- Use Command/Query pattern for write/read operations
- Put EntryPoints (Controllers, Console commands) in `EntryPoint/` subfolder
- Keep related files together: Command, Handler, Request, Response

### ❌ DON'T
- Create controllers directly in `src/*/UI/` or `src/*/Controller/`
- Mix features from different modules
- Use generic "Services" folder for feature logic
- Create "Domain" folders with no feature context

## Structure Template
```
src/
└── User/
    └── Features/
        └── RegisterUser/
            ├── RegisterUserCommand.php
            ├── RegisterUserHandler.php
            ├── EntryPoint/
            │   └── Http/
            │       └── RegisterUserController.php
            ├── Request/
            └── Response/
```

## Violations
If you see code outside this structure, refactor it into the correct location or ask before creating.
