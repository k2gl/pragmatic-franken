# No Spaghetti Code

## Core Principle
Keep features isolated. High cohesion, low coupling.

## Rules

### ✅ DO
- Import what you use: `use App\User\Features\Login\LoginHandler`
- Keep features in their own folder
- Use Events for cross-module communication
- Share infrastructure via `src/Shared/`

### ❌ DON'T
- Create god-objects that know about everything
- Use global state or singletons
- Import from unrelated modules
- Put unrelated logic in the same file

## Coupling Rules
- **User module** → Can depend on: Shared, Events
- **Task module** → Can depend on: Shared, Events, User (read-only)
- **Shared module** → No dependencies on other modules

## Cross-Module Communication
Use Domain Events instead of direct imports:

```php
// ❌ BAD: Direct coupling
$user = $this->userRepository->find($task->userId);

// ✅ GOOD: Event-driven
$dispatcher->dispatch(new UserCreatedEvent($user));
```

## Refactor Trigger
If you see files importing from more than 2 unrelated modules → Refactor needed.
